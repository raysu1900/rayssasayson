            <p> Hi there! My name is Rayssa Sayson, and I am a third-year multimedia arts student at De La Salle College of Saint Benilde. I have been interested in Arts and Design since I was 14. My experiences in my school help me hone my skills in 3d modeling, animation, Digital Illustration, Photography, Filming, and Photo manipulation. Furthermore, my experience in such as doing our Project-Based Learning and performance task helped me to learn how to multitask and prioritize responsibilities. Being a student, We are trained to provide game changing ideas through our creativity.</p>
